<p><a href="mailto:jwilhelmackerley@gmail.com">jwilhelmackerley@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>I am driven by connecting dots, illuminating relationships, and exploring patterns. I am hyper interested in feedback loops and communication platforms especially in problem-solving. I seek to employ my meaningful research and strategy into innovative design for people and the applications/tools they engage with in their lives.</p>
